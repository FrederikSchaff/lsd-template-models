Population Dynamics Template Model

This is an explicit use case of the lsd population module you may access here:
https://github.com/FrederikSchaff/lsd-module-pop

it works with LSD-GIS, which you can get here:
https://github.com/marcov64/Lsd/tree/GIS-beta

Objective: This is a template model, to be used as a starting point for LSD
models where an explicit population model is wanted that includes a heritage
network that survives the agents and allows, for example, to check family
degrees.

The model allows to add statistical population models. Currently one
model is added, called "BLL", following:

  Boucekkine, Raouf; La Croix, David de; Licandro, Omar (2002):
  Vintage Human Capital, Demographic Trends, and Endogenous Growth.
  In Journal of Economic Theory 104 (2), pp. 340–375.
  DOI: 10.1006/jeth.2001.2854.
  
In addition, the Wedding Ring model is implemented explicitly to define partner search:

  Billari, Francesco; Aparicio Diaz, Belinda; Fent, Thomas; Fürnkranz-Prskawetz, 
  Alexia (2007): The "Wedding-Ring". An agent-based marriage model based on 
  social interaction. In Demographic Research 17 (3), pp. 59–82. 
  DOI: 10.4054/DemRes.2007.17.3.
  
  
  
  Model def: 
f_min_w
f_max_w
f_min_f
f_max_f

default model: Randomly select f.
If matched, select prior m partner. Else select random m and match.

For information on how the back-end works, please take a look at the (yet
scarce, I admit) documentation of the population module.
